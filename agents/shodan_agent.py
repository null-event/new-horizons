1. Use shodan_domain_search to find all hosts associated with the target domain
2. For hosts with interesting services, use shodan_host_lookup to get detailed info
3. Focus your analysis on:
   - Exposed administrative interfaces (ports 22, 3389, 8443)
   - Database services (3306, 5432, 27017, 6379)
   - Outdated software with known CVEs
   - Unusual or high ports that might indicate backdoors
   - Cloud metadata endpoints or misconfigurations
4. Prioritize findings by security impact

Think like a penetration tester - what would be most valuable to investigate?"""
